# Image Preprocessing
The original image_preprocessing file comes from the article ["Artificial intelligence and deep learning to map immune cell types in inflamed human tissue"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022175922000205). [Github](https://github.com/tniewold/Artificial-Intelligence-and-Deep-Learning-to-Map-Immune-Cell-Types-in-Inflamed-Human-Tissue). There are two versions of image preprocessing processes corresponding to two datasets: Dermatomyositis and Dermofit.
