# Calculate_Weights
Use Median Frequency Balancing to calculate weight from the article ["Predicting Depth, Surface Normals and Semantic Labels with a Common Multi-Scale Convolutional Architecture"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4734.pdf). The original code comes from [here](https://github.com/yhlleo/DeepSegmentor/blob/master/tools/calculate_weights.py).
